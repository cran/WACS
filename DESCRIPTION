Description: A multivariate weather generator for daily climate variables based 
    on weather-states (Flecher et al. (2010) <doi:10.1029/2009WR008098>). 
    It uses a Markov chain for modeling the succession of weather states. 
    Conditionally to the weather states, the multivariate variables are modeled using the family 
    of Complete Skew-Normal distributions. Parameters are estimated on measured series. Must 
    include the variable 'Rain' and can accept as many other variables as desired.
